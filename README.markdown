Sugar.sugar
========================

The Sugar.sugar aids in the creation of other sugars!

It provides:

* Snippets for common sugar structures (zones, snippets, codesense)
* Regex highlighting (if Regex.sugar is installed)
* Selector highlighting
* Codesense for most tags (hit me up if there is something missing!)

Pretty basic, but hopefully Sugar devs find it useful.
