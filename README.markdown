Sugar.sugar
========================

The Sugar.sugar aids in the creation of other sugars!

It provides:

* Snippets for common sugar structures (zones, snippets, codesense)
* Regex highlighting (if Regex.sugar is installed)
* Selector highlighting

Pretty basic, but hopefully Sugar devs find it useful.
